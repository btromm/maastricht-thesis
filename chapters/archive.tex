%Previous work by \textcite{Girn2022} and \textcite{Singleton2022} has provided indirect support for the idea that the hierarchical gradient spanning unimodal sensory cortex to transmodal association cortex is dedifferentiated under psychedelics, but no direct measures of hierarchy have been used.
%Previous work examining the influence of psychedelics on brain dynamics and network interactions commonly used 
%functional connectivity, which does not allow for causal inference regarding the interactions between regions and 
%networks. Furthermore, previous work has not yet elucidated the functional effects of chronic use of psychedelics 
%-- \textcite{Bouso2015} examined the effect of long-term ayahuasca use on cortical thickness) -- and there exists very few 
%contrast analyses of psychedelics against other substances \parencite{Carhart-Harris2021}.
